# btwcalc

My wife's favourite BTW (Dutch value-added tax) calculator website died, so I reimplemented it in js and hosted it locally, with much assistance from Google and stackexchange, because I don't actually know any javascript. This is the result of that effort.

Behold, the awesome power of my 90s web-development skills.
