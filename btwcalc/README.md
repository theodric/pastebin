# btwcalc

My wife's favourite BTW (Dutch value-added tax) calculator website died, so I reimplemented it in js and hosted it locally, with much assistance from Google and stackexchange, because I don't actually know javascript or HTML to speak of. This is the result of that effort.

If you want, you can use it directly at http://pdp8.nl/btw/
