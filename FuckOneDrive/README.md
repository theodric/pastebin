## FuckYouOneDrive

This is a batch file and 2 registry files to completely remove OneDrive from a Windows 10 system. Might also work on Windows 8.x, but why would you still be running Windows 8.x?

# Use:

Download all 3 files.
Open cmd.exe as Administrator
Run fuckyouonedrive.bat
Reboot.
--done--
