# FuckYouOneDrive

This is a batch file and 2 registry files to completely remove OneDrive from a Windows 10 system. Might also work on Windows 8.x, but why would you still be running Windows 8.x?

## Why?

* Spite - Microsoft forces this shit on you, infects every fucking file dialog with a OneDrive icon, and offers no direct way to remove it
* OneDrive is^W^W^Wgreat but I don't use it
* I already have Google Drive, ownCloud, Keybase, syncthing, and a regular rsync cronjob. I don't need the Microsoft Edge of cloud storage as well.

## Use

* Download all 3 files.
* Open cmd.exe as Administrator
* Run fuckyouonedrive.bat
* Reboot.

--done--

## Thanks
