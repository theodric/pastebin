huge directories & copying differences without waiting a million years for rsync:

man getdents on Linux, compile/run listdir source code from that manpage

listdir | awk '{print $5}' | sed 's/d_off//g' > file on both huge directories

(or if you want to not bullshit around with building additional tools, you can use find, but it's slower. In that case,

find /huge/directory > file on both huge directories )

sort file1 file2 | uniq -u > uniq_lines.txt

in source directory, cat uniq_lines.txt | xargs cp -vf -t /media/veracrypt3/batch1/
